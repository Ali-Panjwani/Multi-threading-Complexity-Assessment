# Multi-threading-Complexity-Assessment

Project Functionality and Specification:
- Analyzed complexity and compiled results of parallel and sequential sorting
- Summarized quantitative data based on results of sorting
- Utilized C++ language and OpenMP framework for parallel programming
- Used doubly linked list data structure for storing data and Merge Sort Algorithm for sorting data


More information about the Project:
This Project was made using Visual Studio 2019
To run a multithreading project in Visual Studio, you should enable a Multithreading option.

Moreover this Repository Contain:
- Project Proposal
- Project Report
- The Project itself containing MultiThreading File and Input creating file.

The output File will be created after running the Multithreading File.
